3D printing refers to processes in which material is joined or solidified under 
computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added 
together (such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together). 3D 
printing is used in both rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing (AM). 
Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using 
digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an 
Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file (usually in sequential layers). 
Stereolithography (STL) is one of the most common file types that is used for 3D 
printing. Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional 
machining process, 3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from 
computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file, usually by successively adding 
material layer by layer.
