					<a href="?page=Aerogel"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Aerogel</h3></div></a>
					<p>Aerogel is a synthetic porous ultralight material derived from a gel, in which the liquid component of the gel has been replaced with a gas. The result is a solid with extremely low density and low thermal conductivity. Nicknames include frozen smoke, solid smoke, solid air, solid cloud, blue smoke owing to its translucent nature and the way light scatters in the material. It feels like fragile expanded polystyrene to the touch. Aerogels can be made from a variety of chemical compounds</p>

					<a href="?page=Airless%20tires"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Airless tires</h3></div></a>
					<p>Airless tires, or non-pneumatic tires (NPT), are tires that are not supported by air pressure. They are used on some small vehicles such as riding lawn mowers and motorized golf carts. They are also used on heavy equipment such as backhoes, which are required to operate on sites such as building demolition, where risk of tire punctures is high. Tires composed of closed-cell polyurethane foam are also made for bicycles and wheelchairs.</p>

					<p>The Drosophila connectome, once completed, will be a complete list of the roughly 135,000 neurons in the brain of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, along with all of the connections (synapses) between these neurons. As of 2013, the Drosophila connectome is a work in progress, being obtained by the methods of neural circuit reconstruction. Portions of two of the 76 compartments of the Drosophila brain have connectomes available, and others are subjects of ongoing study</p>

					<a href="?page=Internet%20of%20things"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Internet of things</h3></div></a>
					<p>The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to inter-operate within the existing Internet infrastructure. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of about 30 billion objects by 2020. It is also estimated that the global market value of IoT will reach $7.1 trillion by 2020. The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention. When IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, virtual power plants, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities</p>

					<p>Atomtronics is an emerging sub-field of ultracold atomic physics which encompasses a broad range of topics featuring guided atomic matter waves. The systems typically include components analogous to those found in electronic or optical systems, such as beam splitters and transistors. Applications range from studies of fundamental physics to the development of practical devices</p>

					<a href="?page=Foodtubes"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Foodtubes</h3></div></a>
					<p>Foodtubes is a proposed network of underground pipeline capsules to transport food and other goods. The system would consist of 2m long metal capsules shifting through underground tunnels at speeds of up to 60 miles (100 km) per hour, directed by linear induction motors and routed by intelligent software to their destinations. The concept was initially developed by Noel Hodson and was engineered and developed for use in the United Kingdom. The Foodtubes group estimates the system construction to cost only $5 million per kilometer (as opposed $28 million per kilometer for 4-lane highways) and claim that implementation of it could save billions of litres of fuel per year, reduce street level pollution and greenhouse gases, and free up congested roads. The group has developed a plan to link all the food outlets, schools and other major buildings in the London borough of Croydon with an estimated construction cost of £400 million and an estimated profits of £80 million per year</p>

					<a href="?page=Cartube"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Cartube</h3></div></a>
					<p>Cartube is a mobility concept which combines two existing modes of transport, automated electric cars and mass transit, into a single, seamless underground road system. Cartube was unveiled on December 2, 2016 at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers by Lars Hesselgren and his research team at London-based practice PLP Architecture.[1] According to Lars Hesselgren, Director of Research at PLP, “CarTube is a direct response to mass transit and traffic congestion in the world’s largest cities. Moving high-speed car traffic below ground will revolutionise our concept of the city, allowing our urban spaces to be designed not for cars, but for people. CarTube has the potential to be the next best thing to teleportation and will revolutionise existing cities and allow for unprecedented urban forms."</p>

					<a href="?page=Hydrogen%20vehicle"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Hydrogen vehicle</h3></div></a>
					<p>A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen-fueled space rockets, as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine, or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy</p>

					<p>The Dutch Automated Vehicle Initiative (DAVI) is a research and demonstration initiative developing automated vehicles for use on public roads.The project is special in that, besides simply making driverless cars, it also focuses on having the automated vehicles share information amongst each other. The aim is to have the cars helping to avoid traffic congestion, by reducing the safety distance between the cars (from 2 seconds drive distance now to just 0.5 seconds) and avoiding sudden traffic slow-downs (due to manoeuvres undertaken by drivers)</p>

					<a href="?page=Brain%20transplant"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Brain transplant</h3></div></a>
					<p>A brain transplant or whole-body transplant is a procedure in which the brain of one organism is transplanted into the body of another. It is a procedure distinct from head transplantation, which involves transferring the entire head to a new body, as opposed to the brain only. Theoretically, a person with advanced organ failure could be given a new and functional body while keeping their own personality, memories, and consciousness through such a procedure. No human brain transplant has ever been conducted. Neurosurgeon Robert J. White, has grafted the head of a monkey onto the headless body of another monkey. EEG readings showed the brain was later functioning normally. It was thought to prove that the brain was an immunologically privileged organ, as the host's immune system did not attack it at first, but immunorejection caused the monkey to die after nine days. Brain transplants and similar concepts have also been explored in various forms of science fiction</p>

					<a href="?page=Jet%20pack"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Jet pack</h3></div></a>
					<p>A jet pack, rocket belt or rocket pack is a device, usually worn on the back, which uses jets of gas (or in some cases liquid) to propel the wearer through the air. The concept emerged from science fiction in the 1960s and became popular as the technology became a reality. The most common use of the jet pack has been in extra-vehicular activities for astronauts. Despite decades of advancement in the technology, many obstacles remain in the way of use of the jetpack in the military or as a means of personal transport, including the challenges of Earth's atmosphere, Earth's gravity, low energy density of available fuels, and the human body not being naturally adapted to fly. To compensate for the limitations of the human body, the jet pack must accommodate for all factors of flight such as lift and stabilization</p>

					<a href="?page=Artificial%20uterus"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Artificial uterus</h3></div></a>
					<p>An artificial uterus (or artificial womb) is a future device that would allow for external pregnancy by growing a fetus outside the body of an organism that would normally carry the fetus to term. To date, no artificial uterus has created a pregnancy from implantation. An artificial uterus, as a replacement organ, would have many applications. It could be used to assist male or female couples in the development of a fetus. This can potentially be performed as a switch from a natural uterus to an artificial uterus, thereby moving the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy. In this sense, it can be regarded as a neonatal incubator with very extended functions. Also, it can potentially be used for initiation of fetal development. Furthermore, it could avail for performing, for example, fetal surgery procedures at an early stage instead of having to postpone them until term of pregnancy. In 2017 fetal researchers at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia published a study showing they had grown premature lamb fetuses for four weeks in an extra-uterine life support system</p>

					<a href="?page=Life%20extension"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Life extension</h3></div></a>
					<p>Life extension science, also known as anti-aging medicine, indefinite life extension, experimental gerontology, and biomedical gerontology, is the study of slowing down or reversing the processes of aging to extend both the maximum and average lifespan. The ability to achieve this, however, does not currently exist. Some researchers in this area, and "life extensionists", "immortalists" or "longevists" (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue rejuvenation, stem cells, regenerative medicine, molecular repair, gene therapy, pharmaceuticals, and organ replacement (such as with artificial organs or xenotransplantations) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition. The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by bioethicists. The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50 billion of revenue a year in 2009. The use of such products has not been proven to be effective or safe</p>

					<a href="?page=Mecha"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Mecha</h3></div></a>
					<p>The term mecha (メカ meka) may refer to both scientific ideas and science fiction genres that centers on robots or machines controlled by people. Mechas are typically depicted as "walker" types of mobile robots. These machines vary greatly in size and shape, but are distinguished from vehicles by their humanoid or biomorphic appearance and size—bigger than a human. Different subgenres exist, with varying connotations of realism. The concept of Super Robot and Real Robot are two such examples found in Japanese anime. The term may also refer to real world piloted humanoid robots/non-humanoid robotic platforms, either currently in existence or still on the drawing board (i.e. at the planning or design stage). Alternatively, in the original Japanese context of the word, "mecha" may refer to mobile machinery/vehicles (including aircraft) in general, manned or otherwise</p>

					<a href="?page=Carbon%20nanothread"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Carbon nanothread</h3></div></a>
					<p>A carbon nanothread (informally “diamond” nanothread) is a sp3-bonded, one-dimensional carbon crystalline nanomaterial. The tetrahedral sp3-bonding of its carbon is similar to that of diamond. Nanothreads are only a few atoms across, more than 20,000 times thinner than a human hair. They consist of a stiff, strong carbon core surrounded by hydrogen atoms. Carbon nanotubes, although also one-dimensional nanomaterials, in contrast have sp2-carbon bonding as is found in graphite</p>

					<a href="?page=Ferroelectric%20RAM"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Ferroelectric RAM</h3></div></a>
					<p>Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM, F-RAM or FRAM) is a random-access memory similar in construction to DRAM but using a ferroelectric layer instead of a dielectric layer to achieve non-volatility. FeRAM is one of a growing number of alternative non-volatile random-access memory technologies that offer the same functionality as flash memory. FeRAM's advantages over flash include: lower power usage, faster write performance and a much greater maximum read/write endurance (about 1010 to 1014 cycles). FeRAMs have data retention times of more than 10 years at +85 °C (up to many decades at lower temperatures). Market disadvantages of FeRAM are much lower storage densities than flash devices, storage capacity limitations, and higher cost. FeRAM also has the unusual technical disadvantage of a destructive read process, necessitating a write-after-read architecture</p>

					<a href="?page=Fluidics"><div class="ui medium centered header"><h3>Fluidics</h3></div></a>
					<p>Fluidics, or fluidic logic, is the use of a fluid to perform analog or digital operations similar to those performed with electronics. The physical basis of fluidics is pneumatics and hydraulics, based on the theoretical foundation of fluid dynamics. The term fluidics is normally used when devices have no moving parts, so ordinary hydraulic components such as hydraulic cylinders and spool valves are not considered or referred to as fluidic devices. The 1960s saw the application of fluidics to sophisticated control systems, with the introduction of the fluidic amplifier. A jet of fluid can be deflected by a weaker jet striking it at the side. This provides nonlinear amplification, similar to the transistor used in electronic digital logic. It is used mostly in environments where electronic digital logic would be unreliable, as in systems exposed to high levels of electromagnetic interference or ionizing radiation</p>
