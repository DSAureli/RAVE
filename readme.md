# RAVE

Rave stands for "Resources annotator, Visualizer and Enhancer".
This web app aims to visualize and annotate contents from Wikipedia and Crossref. A login system with a database for
annotations is included.

## TODO

* handle disambiguation pages
* handle no result case
* login system
* genius (modal on smartphones)
* improve Crossref results and presentation
* footer
* update jQuery and SemanticUI
* remake icon with definitive colors once decided
* maybe add search bar suggestion dropdown (would be cool)
