# RAVE

Rave stands for "Resources annotator, Visualizer and Enhancer".
This web app aims to visualize and annotate contents from Wikipedia and Crossref. A login system with a database for
annotations is included.

## TODO

* eval Introduction position presence/position
* make all the queries at once and save sections in memory (toeval) (maybe not)
* handle ambiguous list of wiki search results
* handle no result case (for now the old search results keep being displayed)
* redirect page not shown in Edge (test with "Kara no Kyoukai")
* maybe add search bar suggestion dropdown (would be cool)
* improve Wiki presentation
* improve Crossref results and presentation
* login system
* genius (modal on smartphones)
* footer
* dropdown highlight fucks up if scrollbar is present (Firefox only?) (Semantic UI bug) (not present anymore?)
* update jQuery and SemanticUI
