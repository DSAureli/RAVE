# RAVE...

... where bakers make bread and programmers swear

## TODO

* eval Introduction position presence/position
* fix automatic selection in dropdown at the changing of section (?)
* "sales" and "critical reception" are duplicated
* mouse scroll does not work on dropdown if mouse pointer is not exactly over the dropdown scrollbar (it scrolls the page instead) (tested on Firefox)
* make all the queries at once and save sections in memory (toeval) (maybe not)
* handle ambiguous list of wiki search results
* handle no result case (for now the old search results keep being displayed)
* redirect page not shown in Edge (test with "Kara no Kyoukai")
* maybe add search bar suggestion dropdown (would be cool)
* improve Wiki presentation
* improve Crossref results and presentation
* login system
* genius (modal on smartphones)
* footer
* dropdown highlight fucks up if scrollbar is present (Firefox only?) (Semantic UI bug) (not present anymore?)
* update jQuery and SemanticUI
