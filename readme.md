# RAVE...

... where bakers make bread and programmers swear

## TODO

* eval Introduction position presence/position
* make all the queries at once and save sections in memory (toeval)
* handle ambiguous list of wiki search results
* redirect page not shown in Edge (test with "Kara no Kyoukai")
* maybe add search bar suggestion dropdown (would be cool)
* improve Wiki presentation
* improve Crossref results and presentation
* login system
* genius (modal on smartphones)
* footer
* dropdown highlight fucks up if scrollbar is present (Firefox only?) (Semantic UI bug)
